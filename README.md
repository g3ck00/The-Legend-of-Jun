# The-Legend-of-Jun
Simple 2D “collect and win” game in Java.

I have uploaded the game with the sole purpose of being useful for new Java programmers. The code is quite interesting and challenging to understand for anyone who is starting out in the world of Java programming.

Characteristics:

* Uses the Windows console as a graphical environment (not guaranteed to work on other platforms).

* The player can move through a 2D plane using the WASD keys.

* Random generation of obstacles.

* The game ends in defeat if the player collides with an obstacle.

* Random generation of objects to collect ("pieces of value").

* The game concludes with a victory if the player collects all valuable pieces.

* Other features...
